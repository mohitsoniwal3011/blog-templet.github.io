            Featured articles are considered to be some of the best articles Wikipedia has to offer, as determined by
            Wikipedia's editors. They are used by editors as examples for writing other articles. Before being listed
            here, articles are reviewed as featured article candidates for accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style
            according to our featured article criteria. Most featured articles were previously good articles (which are
            reviewed with a less restrictive set of criteria). There are 6,046 featured articles out of 6,433,844
            articles on the English Wikipedia (about 0.09% or one out of every 1,060 articles). Articles that no longer
            meet the criteria can be proposed for improvement or removal at featured article review. <br>

            On non-mobile versions of our website, a small bronze star icon (This star symbolizes the featured content
            on Wikipedia.) on the top right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is featured. On most
            smartphones and tablets you can also select "Desktop" at the very bottom of the page or "Request Desktop
            Site" in your browser's menu to see this line (do a search to find out how). Additionally, if the current
            article is featured in another language, a star will appear next to the corresponding entry in the Languages
            list in the sidebar to let you know. <br>
